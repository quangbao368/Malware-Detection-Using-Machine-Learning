# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning

This project develops a machine learning tool for detecting malware based on static analysis of binaries. It uses various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify files as either benign or malicious based on their binary features.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to enhance cybersecurity efforts by automatically identifying potential malware without executing the binary files. It leverages Python and several powerful libraries including pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: Analyze binary files without execution to ensure safety.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes Decision Trees and Random Forest for classification.
- **Feature Selection**: Implements feature selection to improve model accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Grid Search to find the best model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures the model's robustness across different subsets of data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
